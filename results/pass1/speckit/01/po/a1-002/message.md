I've written the implementation plan and design documents for step 1 and committed them to `main` as `7d5054e`. There is still no code; only the design is done. No extension hooks are registered, before or after planning.

**Generated in `specs/001-config-load-show-set/`:**
- `plan.md`: summary, technical context, file layout under `src/troupe/` and `tests/`, design overview, and the constitution check. All principles pass both before and after the design, so there are no exceptions to justify.
- `research.md`: technical choices R-1 to R-16, plus finer behaviour choices B-1 to B-12 for corners the contract doesn't cover.
- `data-model.md`: the parsed configuration (where each value sits in its file), leaves, how a `set` produces its events, and how the event store works.
- `contracts/cli.md`: command syntax, output formats and the exit-code table.
- `quickstart.md`: the quality-gate commands and a 13-step manual walk-through.

**Main design decisions:**
- **Two libraries, checked in a scratch project:**
  - `ruamel.yaml` is used only to find where each value sits in the file. Its own writer reformats files, so it is never used to write.
  - `eventsourcing` 9.5.5 stores events in `.troupe/events.sqlite3`. I confirmed they survive between separate commands.
- **Own number/boolean rules:** one function applies the YAML 1.2 rules for telling strings, numbers, booleans and null apart. It is used both for file values and for `VALUE` on the command line.
- **Check before every write:** a `set` edits only the needed bytes of the one file holding the value. Before writing, the tool re-reads the edited configuration in memory. If the target value is wrong or anything else changed, it refuses with exit 3 and writes nothing.
- **Safe writes:** files are replaced in one step, so they are never left half-written, and nothing is written when a `set` changes nothing.

**Corners where I made a call (worth checking before implementation):**
- **B-3, a scalar replaced by a block collection:** the old value is removed from the key's line, any end-of-line comment stays at its column, and the new lines go below.
- **B-4 and B-5, replacing a collection:** the whole old collection is replaced, and comments inside it are removed with it.
- **R-3, `VALUE` that isn't a flow node:** something like `a: b` or `- x` is treated as a usage error (exit 2).

**Next step:** `/speckit-tasks`.

The spec for step 4 (lineage) is written and committed on `feat/troupe-config-lineage`, and the next phase is `/spec-kitty.plan`. No code has changed yet, so nothing is on `main` so far. The plan is to merge this branch into `main` at the end, as the last mission did. Nothing has been pushed.

**Your three open choices, as I decided them.** Each is recorded in the spec and as a decision record, not as a contract change:
- **Events recorded before step 4:** `history` shows what is truly known and marks the rest unknown:
  - `at` is the time already stored with each event.
  - The actor is `{"kind":"unknown","id":null}` and `reason` is `null`.
  - `via` is `"import"` for old imports and `null` for old `set`/`remove` events, because a CLI `set` and a file reconcile can't be told apart.
  - `change` is a fixed id unique to each old event.
  
  Stored events are never rewritten. I chose this over refusing to read the history because refusing would hide a user's existing audit trail. Every event recorded from step 4 on has a `via` the contract allows.
- **When `TROUPE_ACTOR` is checked:** after argument parsing, before the theatre is located or loaded. A bad value exits 2 even if the config also can't be loaded, and the command records nothing, not even an import or reconcile.
- **Login name not found:** the actor is `{"kind":"human","id":null}` and the command still runs. The unknown id is stated rather than invented.

Your confirmed answers are in the spec as rules:
- The reconcile a command runs first is a separate change from the command's own events, and so is any import it triggers.
- Each `watch` reconcile is its own change.
- `--reason` exists only on `set`. It is stored as given, and dropped when the `set` records nothing.
- Every `troupe config` command checks `TROUPE_ACTOR`.
- The history line keys are in the order you approved.

The spec has 14 functional requirements, 5 non-functional requirements and 5 constraints. The quality checklist passes, `decision verify` is clean, and there are no open questions left in it.

**Three choices I made on my own while writing the spec.** They're listed as edge cases and assumptions; tell me if you want any changed:
- `--reason ""` is stored as `""`, not `null`.
- All events in one change share the same `at`.
- A `TROUPE_ACTOR` id is everything after the first `:`, so `human:alice:x` is accepted.

**Repository state:**
- **Commits:** the spec and checklist (`0d0105e`), then the decision records (`af3c6d6`, `a252fbb`).
- **Not committed:** `status.events.jsonl` changes after every spec-kitty command. There is also an empty `plan.md` template, created when I ran the plan setup command to check readiness. I left both for the plan phase.

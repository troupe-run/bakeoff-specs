## Generated Requirements Summary
I wrote seven requirements:
- **1. Reconcile first:** `show` and `set` reconcile before doing their own work, and keep the events even if they then exit 3 or 5. `history` never reconciles, though it still imports a theatre that has never been imported. A usage error or load failure records nothing. A hand edit made before a `set` is recorded ahead of the `set`'s own event.
- **2. Reconcile events:** a changed leaf gets `set` with the recorded value as `old`. A new leaf gets `set` with `old` null, and a leaf no longer in the files gets `remove`. Edits to formatting, comments or quoting record nothing, but a change of type does. All events from one reconcile are saved together or not at all, with consecutive `seq`: `set` events first, then `remove` events.
- **3. Includes added or removed by hand:** their leaves are recorded, and `watch` starts or stops following those files.
- **4–5. `watch`:** it uses the same default theatre as the other commands. It prints `watching <dir>` only once a change is certain to be seen, and reconciles within 2 seconds of a change. It also notices files saved by rename and `troupe.yml`↔`troupe.yaml` renames. SIGINT or SIGTERM exits 0, and a startup failure exits 4 under the step 1 rules.
- **6–7. Write-back and clean-up:** a `set` running alongside `watch` records exactly its own events. Each hand edit is recorded once, and events from two commands never interleave. Nothing new is left behind, and the history store is closed when a command ends.

Where the contract is silent, I made these choices; each is listed in the requirements and still needs recording in `research.md`:
- If the files can't be loaded while `watch` runs, it records nothing, reports the problem and keeps running. It never treats that as every leaf being removed.
- If the history store fails while `watch` runs, it reports the failure and retries later.
- Edits made in quick succession may be recorded as their net difference.
- `<dir>` is printed as it was given.

The Boundary Context section lists the step 1 criteria this replaces: config-foundation 6.9 and 7.3. It also notes the changed example in config-set-writeback 15.1.

## Document Status
- `.kiro/specs/config-file-sync/requirements.md` is written.
- `.kiro/specs/config-file-sync/spec.json` is at phase `requirements-generated`, with requirements marked generated but not approved.
- Both are committed on `main` (`28e738a`).

## Review Gate
The draft passed after one repair pass. Every heading has a numeric ID and every criterion has the EARS form. There are no technology terms in the requirements. The repair rewrote 5.5 and 6.1 into EARS form and gave a precise ordering rule for `remove` events (2.6).

## Next Steps
Review the requirements, especially the silent-contract choices. Then optionally run a gap analysis before moving to design:
```
/kiro-validate-gap config-file-sync
/kiro-spec-design config-file-sync
